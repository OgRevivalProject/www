## IN PROGRESS

### This site is currently under heavy development. 

### Planned: 

1. A *Right to Repair page* and how to help!
2. A *readme* with all sorts of information for you freaks who like to look at the GitHub repository.

3. A *license* with all sorts of legalese that'll tell you all about what you can and cannot do with the information hosted within the repository.

4. A *contribution page* with all sorts of ways that you can contribute to us, our projects, etc.

5. A *contact us page* where you can speak your words into the Deep Void and hear a response echo back.

6. A *code of conduct page* with all sorts of codes, morals, expectations of conduct, ethics, and values that shall guide us into the Light of Restoration instead of the Darkness of Breaking Your Controller.

7. A *wiki* with information about consoles(more to come), starting with a full deep-dive into the Xbox 360. This wiki will host everything from basic information to deep technical information. More information to come soon!

8. A *YouTube channel* where we will livestream and post content related to our work, the wiki, etc.

9. A *shop* where you can buy things from us.

10. A *Research and Development page* where we will host information regarding our R&D work.

11. A *ranking* page, where you can see the rankings of any user registered with the system in our Discord. This will include a special section for shops. Speaking of which...

12. A *Discord*! Yeah, we know everyone has one, so we have to have one too. However, we intend to *integrate* the community, rather than *fragment* them. So, we intend to include many integrations with: many subreddits, other Discords, loads of categories you can access(via various opt-in roles, as to reduce clutter for end users), default ""@mentions only" as it *should be*, loads of events, giveaways, etc. to make *this* server worth your time.

13. A *affiliate program*! Do you offer relevant/related products/services? Why compete when we can *work together*?! Contact me at affiliates@phoenixconsoles.org for more information!

14. The mysterious *OpenXenon* project. It's about to get less mysterious. The OpenXenon project is a project which involves developing open source hardware and software for developing for and emulating/running natively the Xbox 360 (Xenon Architecture) and accompanying OS. If you are interested in joining this project contact us as openxenon@phoenixconsoles.org.
